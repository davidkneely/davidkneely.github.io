We've identified a few bugs: (1) The waveform does not resize properly when resizing the window, and (2) There's an issue with retrieving MP3 files from the bundle due to permission errors when restarting the app. Additionally, using Cursor AI's Auto model selection has caused errors: one where Cursor fails to recognize an existing class file and another where the Swift linter introduces issues that Cursor keeps iterating on unnecessarily. Adam will investigate these bugs this week."

Since those partnerships didn’t work out, we’re considering launching it ourselves on the iOS App Store for free with Google Ads. I plan to experiment with TikTok marketing to drive organic interest. This will also give me an opportunity to log into my Google AdSense account and check on an issue affecting ads in my other game, Mathogen."

              "content": "Recently, a customer left a review pointing out a duplicated word in one of my puzzles. That kind of feedback can sting, but I see it as a gift. I opened up Cursor and loaded the Python script I use to generate the puzzles. Using the Claude Sonnet 3.7 model, I updated the logic to filter out duplicates and sort the word list alphabetically. A small change, but it ensures a smoother experience for future customers—and shows them I care about the details."

I spent a while stuck, unsure how to programmatically highlight the solution words in a clear and scalable way. Then, during a chat with my friend Adam (who needed a logo), I mentioned I’d been generating SVGs for icons using Cursor. That idea stuck with me: what if I rendered the answer keys as SVGs?"

              "title": "The SVG Solution",
              "content": "SVGs turned out to be the perfect format. They scale well, print cleanly, and allow for flexible layouts. I spent about 90 minutes working with Cursor to refine the rendering: early attempts either circled every letter or drew unreadable lines through diagonals. Eventually, I got the styling right—but I hit another problem. Overlapping highlights obscured shared letters, which made the solution unreadable. So I updated the generation logic to intelligently layer highlights without sacrificing clarity."

              "title": "Overlapping Letters and Layout Challenges",
              "content": "I also realized the puzzles weren’t overlapping words at all—each letter was used by only one word. That’s not how real puzzles work! I tweaked the code to allow for shared letters and better word placement. It felt like a small but meaningful win: not just fixing the issue, but improving the product. And now, with SVGs for both puzzles and solutions, everything looks better and is easier to manage."

              "content": "My next goal is to automate the layout further. I want to generate an SVG that includes the puzzle number, the word search grid, and a two-column list of hidden words—all in one go. That way, I can ditch the clunky Pages mail merge and use a clean CSV-to-SVG pipeline instead. With just three columns—puzzle, solution, and metadata—I’ll be able to produce hundreds of pages with consistent, beautiful formatting."

Whether it's refining an old Python script or designing better UX through automation, I approach every project with care, curiosity, and an eye for detail. If you’re looking for someone to help build thoughtful, well-engineered digital products, I’d love to collaborate."

My goal was to programmatically add the hidden words and the puzzle ID to each SVG, and then export those completed files in bulk. I set up a Python script to handle it, which was surprisingly smooth thanks to the help of Cursor AI. With just a few tweaks, I managed to export 1,000 SVGs to a folder—exactly what I needed to streamline the process."

              "content": "Initially, I thought about using Mac Pages for a mail merge, but I quickly hit a wall with its limitations—particularly when it came to handling images in bulk. Rather than let that slow me down, I decided to tackle it head-on. I used Cursor AI to write a Python script that would merge the SVGs into a single PDF file. This worked perfectly for both the puzzles and the solutions, and the automation saved me hours of manual work."

DigitalOcean looks like a solid pick at $4/month. It’s a minor pivot, but one that will give us a lot more flexibility as we continue development."

He recently resolved a GitHub hiccup and is finalizing a new push with updated code. Once that’s in, I’ll be updating the color scheme based on our latest design direction.\n\nHe also created new buttons using SVGs with Cursor, which I’m really looking forward to seeing. Small things like icons can really shape the feel of a product, and I appreciate that we both take pride in those details."

I don’t have a fully fleshed-out architecture yet, but that’s part of the fun.\n\nWe’re planning to leverage AI in the workflow, especially for tagging and search. Maybe we’ll even experiment with location-aware features. One big lesson from our past attempts: we’re going to be more intentional this time about how AI generates code. Specifically, we’ll make sure it sticks to a markdown file structure we define upfront. That kind of structure saves a lot of cleanup later on."

Sometimes the fastest way to learn is just to see someone else do it and follow along."

All of that theory is already influencing how I build software that teaches, engages, and adapts."

I’m currently diving deeper into Laravel’s built-in authentication and billing modules. Stripe integration is top priority, and I’m confident that once that’s in place, we’ll be unstoppable."

Sales on my Etsy shop have been slowly dipping, and I’ve been wondering if it’s just the season or if I’ve gone too quiet. Maybe both.\n\nInstead of waiting around, I’ve decided to shift into creation mode. I’m experimenting with new planners—each tailored to a different kind of person. A budget planner. A workout planner. A visual planner for people who think in images. I want to meet people where they are, and Etsy is a great place to do that."

What used to take me hours by hand—especially trying to force Canva to do something it wasn’t built for—now takes a fraction of the time.\n\nCursor helps me go from idea to prototype without getting stuck on the boring stuff. It’s made the whole process feel more like play again, and less like grinding through glue."

It’s one of those side projects that has the potential to grow into something much bigger."

What I really want is to close loops. Not just start things, but finish them. Wrap them up. Deliver. That’s where the real peace comes from for me. Not in doing less, but in completing what matters.\n\nAlso, Seth Godin just released a new book. That’s now at the top of my reading list. He always has a way of reminding me why I build things the way I do—with heart, intention, and a desire to serve."
