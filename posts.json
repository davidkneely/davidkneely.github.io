              "title": "Slomo: A MacOS Music Slowdown App",
              "content": "We had a productive meeting with Aron regarding Slomo, our MacOS music slowdown app built with Catalyst and SwiftUI. We've identified a few bugs: (1) The waveform does not resize properly when resizing the window, and (2) There's an issue with retrieving MP3 files from the bundle due to permission errors when restarting the app. Additionally, using Cursor AI's Auto model selection has caused errors: one where Cursor fails to recognize an existing class file and another where the Swift linter introduces issues that Cursor keeps iterating on unnecessarily. Aron will investigate these bugs this week."

              "content": "We revisited an app we developed last year, originally pitched to local airline companies for inflight entertainment. Since those partnerships didn’t work out, we’re considering launching it ourselves on the iOS App Store for free with Google Ads. I plan to experiment with TikTok marketing to drive organic interest. This will also give me an opportunity to log into my Google AdSense account and check on an issue affecting ads in my other game, Mathogen."

              "title": "Bookmark Manager App: Choosing the Right Stack",
              "content": "Instead of jumping into coding with Cursor, we took a step back to research the best stack for our bookmark manager project. After evaluating our options, we decided on Laravel for the backend and React for the frontend. This week, I'll be looking into hosting solutions, and Aron and I will check in next week to finalize details and plan our next steps."

          "conclusion": "We’ve made great strides in debugging Slomo, pivoting our inflight entertainment app strategy, and finalizing the tech stack for our bookmark manager. Next week, we’ll continue refining these projects and making key implementation decisions. Stay tuned for more updates!"
